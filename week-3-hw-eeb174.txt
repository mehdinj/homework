Question 1: 

1.11.2) Hormone levels in baboons 

1. command:

cut -f 1 Gesquiere2011_data.csv | grep -c -w 3
cut -f 1 Gesquiere2011_data.csv | grep -c -w 27

#first command will cut the first column and counts the number of occurances of 3.
#second command does a similar function for the number of occurances of 27.


2.command:

# first, we should read the input:
# $1 variable is file name and $2 is male ID

#! /bin/bash
cut -f 1 $1 | grep -c -w $2
# this command will cut the first column of the file name $1 and grep function counts the number of occurances of male ID=$2.
# we then have to save the file as .sh file in scripts folder setup previously.
# execution permission should also be changed using --> 
 chmod u+x occurance.sh

an example of input and output of the script:
eeb177-student@eeb177-VirtualBox:~/Desktop/eeb-177/CSB/unix/data$ occurance.sh Gesquiere2011_data.csv 1
10



3.command:

#this script will first extract all uniqe IDs by removing the header, cutting the first column and sorting and applying uniq function.
#this script will then go through a loop of uniqe IDs and counts and prints the number of occurances of all IDs.

#! /bin/bash

IDS=$( tail -n +2 Gesquiere2011_data.csv | cut -f 1| sort -n| uniq)

for id in $IDS
do
  number=$(cut -f 1 Gesquiere2011_data.csv | grep -c -w $id)
  echo "ID: $id number of occurances of ID= $number"
done



Question 2:  1.11.3)

1.command:
#this script will take an input of filename. This first line of code will calculate and returns the number of rows for that specific file.
#The second line will calculate and returns the number of columns in that specific file inside the Saavedra2013 directory.

#! /bin/bash

echo "Number of rows:"
cat ~/Desktop/eeb-177/CSB/unix/data/Saavedra2013/$1 | wc -l
echo "Number of columns:"
head -n 1  ~/Desktop/eeb-177/CSB/unix/data/Saavedra2013/$1 | tr -d ' ' | tr -d '\n' | wc -c


2.command:
#this script will extract all files within Saavedra2013 and calculates 
#and returns the number of files in each file within Saacedra2013 directory.

#! /bin/bash

for file in ~/Desktop/eeb-177/CSB/unix/data/Saavedra2013/*.txt
do
    myrow=`cat $file | wc -l`
    mycol=`head -n 1 $file | tr -d ' ' | tr -d '\n' | wc -c`
    echo $file $myrow $mycol
done


3. #we have to first make the last function (#2) as an script (size.sh) in script folders:
#first line of code gives the file name with the largest number of rows 
#second line of code gives the file name with the largest number of columns

bash size.sh | sort -n -r -k 2 | head -n 1
bash size.sh | sort -n -r -k 3 | head -n 1
